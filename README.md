# MIS for Orthopedic Salons

## Patient Data Storage System for Clinics

The application is built on the Laravel framework and the Filament admin panel. It serves as a patient registry for a network of orthopedic salons, allowing for the recording of foot images, parameters, and recommendations during a doctor's appointment. It is designed for use across a network of clinics with multiple branches and doctors, featuring a user rights segregation system, appointment statistics, and flexibly configurable lists of diagnoses and recommendations.
